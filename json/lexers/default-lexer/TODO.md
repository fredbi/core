# TODOs default lexer

* [] status good enough for testing
* [] refact to reduce repeated code between L and VL
* [] default safeguards when io.Reader mode?
* [] benchmarks
* [] comparative benchmarks (e.g. with easyjson and perhaps some others)
* [] test with pools
* [] verbatim doesn't alter strings
* [] stackable error context (store multiple errors from caller)
* [] recover from errors and may resume parsing
